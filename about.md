This is a manga creation and general art blog that approaches topics about Otaku culture, and the way that manga readers in general have been forgotten or misunderstood by the modern Regressive Left.

I identify my idealogy as "The Left Wing Of Comicsgate"; Comicsgate ventures into genuinely bigoted territories and ruining an otherwise good message of skepticism of woke idealogy.

We believe in:

-- A strong support network for independant creators.
-- A strong social welfare state to support the arts, including Universal Basic Income
-- Acknowledge that racism and transphobia are real issues, but doesnt excuse the excesses of woke idealogy.
-- Believes in making ones own artistic tools, including brushes, ink, and pens.
-- Believes that Anti Comicsgate has become its own harassment campaign supported by big tech and large comic publishers.
-- A "Global Culture War" is erupting, and the people that best can prevent this are those left of center economically.
-- Primarily focus on the manga industry.
