Manga is not inherently a political conservative medium, nor it is inherently a radical leftist medium. Manga is a variety of different dissimilar sequential art forms that originated in Japan and made popular by companies like Tokyopop. Like all comic industries, there are left wing and right wing factions in it.

But you would never get this information if your primary diet about learning what manga is primarily came from people like The Quartering or Ethan Van Sciver. Who spend most of their time getting angry at each other rather than actually getting any real meaningful work done.

There are specific magazines like Garo that by accounts could legitimately be considered Left-Wing Manga Magazines, and some of the founders are extremely well known for their left-wing viewpoints. Such as the creator of the story, whom the magazine was named after, Garo.

You can find the wikipedia article on the magazine here: [Garo Magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garo_(magazine))

Manga might not be considered Regressive Left, as defined by channels like Samizdat Broadcasts, but there are infinite varieties of left-wing thought, you don’t need me to cite all the different forms of Anarchism. But is it is Left-Wing in a sense that is unique and specific to Japanese culture around the middle ages.

And that’s a large part of the problem, alt-right groups like that don’t have to have traditionally good arguements, they have to repeat these arguments an infinite number of times so the slogan will stick, and this is also why they say proven falsehoods like “SJWs don’t buy comics”. Their world view is not based on facts and evidence, but rather feelings.

And the worst of this, is part of the left-wing in American comics is repeating this same mistake.
