This essay is about how the way the New Left frames issues around racial relations opens the door for the right wing to label leftists hypocrites. Youll notice that there is a coordinated effort to frame leftist issues around wokeism, even though the issue has always been to eliminate capitalism, or come as close as possible to achieving this.

A lot of right wing criticism of the left stems from making it look like we dont consistently care about racial relations, or more recently gender and trans relationships. Certainly it is true that the new left mainly seems to care about cultural issues rather than counter economics. And the fact that the old Left had largely ignored Breadtube compounded this issue.

But the primary goal of communists has always been toward trying to achieve post capitalist societies that focus on public ownership and means of production. Although there is a heavy coersive element in this, and thats how you get some of the worst dictatorships.

What is left unnoted is the Far Lefts disdain for libertarianism and specifically voluntaryism. But Voluntary means that every economic relationship is done through a strictly voluntary basis, and that all relationships are built on the idea of consent:

That you and only you are the sole ownership of your own body. And yet this doesnt have to be mutually exclusive from Marxist ideas about class struggle and uplifting the working class out of poverty.

Rather increasingly my feeling is to combine aspects of strictly voluntary association in tandem with the ideas and standards of working class solidarity. You can have little pocket communities that experiment with different interpretations of Marxist class analyses based on the individual needs of that community.

In this way Marxists can have a little bit of what they want, and Voluntaryists can have a little bit of what they want while making everyone richer by not plundering them with artificial scarcity.
