There are several videos describing what Comicsgate is, but few videos to describe what to do if you find yourself attacked by such hate mobs in nerd culture. It was my hope some videos on Breadtube would also cover this issue, yet to date there has only been one that has really addressed the topic, and only as a historical footnote and not as an ongoing problem LGBT creators experience. Note that what section of nerd culture this will happen will always change, and it’s better to see the signs of this regardless of whether it’s movies, games, comics, or novels.

You wake up one morning, and find that you’ve been blocked by someone you had never interacted with before, and then trying to investigate the reasons why this was so you can mediate the problem. Then when you discuss the issue on Twitter, you end up with a bunch of angry bearded men started arguments about comics, and in your specific case comic creation. Then suddenly you’re finding yourself hate followed by swarms of these men whose sole purpose seems to be to reply guy about your creation process.

You try to get it together enough, but find as soon as you try to find the chain blocker, you have a bunch of these guys trying to threaten you out of chain blocking them. You also find it doesn’t seem to matter what your politics are, if you’re an LGBT person, as no matter what it is you that is always the screw up and not them.

You’re not crazy, this has happened to several other LGBT creators on Youtube. Do note that supposed advocates in comics are probably not going to help you either. But there are ways of circumventing the problem before it becomes worse:

(1. If you have a Youtube, hide your videos and content.
(2. If you hate a twitter, lock it privately so more of these cannot follow you. Use social media where you don’t have to interact with them, preferably invite only like Ello.
(3. If you find your channel on Youtube is being dog piled on, slowly move your content over to an unrelated email, because these people find and stalk you based on your email address.

There are other ways to circumvent this problem, but remember that it is not your fault that your being attacked by this hate mob in nerd culture, and once it becomes fashionable to divide and conquer another section in nerd culture, they will do so, and leave the industry in ruins. Luckily I had a back up email I never used, and this is where I’m starting my new channel.

What has made the problem worse, was that Youtube was not paying attention to actual issues on their website that made it possible for --gate prefix type people to stalk Leftists like myself, such as: filing false copyright claims ( I have a sneaking suspicion this was the real reason my Ticktock export to Youtube was flagged ). I had my videos disliked bombed for months on end without as much of an explanation why this was happening.

Also now that I use Peertube, they also have the option of blacklisting domains that tend to harbor people that harass LGBT creators like myself. What was incredible is when I was interacting with them, some were trying to encourage me to switch over to LBRY. But I’m not going to support any video host that is decentralized that doesn’t enable instance blocking in some ways, as it works like a chain block.

Hopefully this gives you somewhat of an introduction to solving the problem, if for some reason you’re attacked by hate groups like the Alt Right and Comicsgate.
