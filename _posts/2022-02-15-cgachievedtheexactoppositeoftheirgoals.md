Which brings me to a personal thing in Red Serpent Inks: [Woke idealogy is now coming after manga.](

### INTRO
Comicsgate achieved the exact opposite of their goals. That community also became overran with right-wing reactionaries, even if the original goal to combat queer washing in the comics industry. Evan Van Sciver already had the reputation for being somewhat of a bully in the industry anyway.

But there is no reason a working class revolt has to necessarily go in such a right-wing direction in order to be effective against hyper-wokeness and queer washing, with bad representations in American comics. We need to abandon the idea of a “Consumer Revolt”, because anything with consumer in the title inherently conveys the idea of a harassment campaign against creators, which never should been allowed to be a part of revolts, and indicates that Comicsgate was never really about workers rights.

However consumer rights and workers rights cannot really be realistically separated in this manner. We also need to separate ourselves from Race Baiting lunatics like Richard C Meyer and Ethan Van Sciver. The issue with the comics industry is not about starting a race war, but to work against the industry itself inciting its own race and gender war directed against left-wing creators.

In this dynamic, both comic book creators and comic book readers should not necessarily be enemies here. I don’t see myself as the enemy of comic readers; I do however enforce my right to define my own target audience, which always seems to be squashed by white men in the industry.

So where do we go from here?

## The Booming Manga Industry
The manga industry has started to have another boom, thanks to pod casts about the topic, although some people interested in manga decry the excessive use of 3D rendering technology in the Anime industry, that adapts manga. There is a growing disconnect between the old guard that seeks to maintain the status quo in manga, and those who seek to take the industry in a excessively Woke direction by the Regressive Left.

But neither is the direction that we need to take: it is possible to embrace natural diversity, stemmed from actual interaction with target minorities like LGBT people, without shoehorning new gender pronouns, and other nonsense created by Critical Race Theory, and other lines of Critical Theory in the academic framework.

But there is something to be said for a strong welfare framework that allows the state to publicly finance creators that meet a certain merit threshold. Things like art supplies and a supply of writers for a propaganda network can be beneficial to the larger comic book and manga ecosystem.

Something to consider however: who exactly is it to define what qualifies are having merit to be financed by the government when authors are blacklisted do to changing witch hunts that involve both traditional and McCarthyism Inverso?

## WHAT I SEEK
I seek the right to create my own constructed language that inoculates true left-wing creators from the excesses of both the Regressive Left ( Breadtube ) and the Regressive Right ( such as what Comicsgate eventually became ).

We also must distance ourselves from the anarchist community, who have absorbed much of the language of Academic theories that serve mainly to divide the left from being able to properly fight against Comicsgate and other reactionary forces that both seek to undo the progress already made for Leftist creators who are LGBT, and prevent language hijacking which is important for knowing what creative tools are, and other important processes for creating art.

The Manga Industry waited to late to cater to the needs of a community raised on Tokyopop and and Yen Press.

## ON HASHTAGS
At present I have no plans on using hashtags because of the tendency to be hijacked by both the regressive left ( basically Academic Leftists ) and the extreme right, who both screw over LGBT creators in different ways. However we will use invite-only creator platforms like Ello to share our art with the world.

Hashtags unrelated to the movement may be used, may actually prove to be preferable over official categorization systems.

## Art Tools
This section is about art tools. This movement encourages making your own art tools, but they must be within the technological capabilities of Joan Of Arc to August Renoir's time period.

I found some links that will guide you in the general direction.
