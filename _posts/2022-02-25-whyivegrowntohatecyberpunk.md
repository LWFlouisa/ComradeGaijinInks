I've grown to absolutely despise the Cyberpunk genre, much in the same way I despise the manga industry. It seems like for every single good thing you find as a casual reader, there is always going to be a certain amount of grifters and con men hijacking the interest for personal gain.

For example, Cyberpunk originally started as a warning of what the future might become, and yes this also includes environmental extremists that are actual literal terrorists bombing buildings like in Final Fantasy 7.

I shouldn't even have to say that Cyberpunk novels are not meant to be Larping or Roleplay manuals, and yet there is always that one guy in Cyberpunk circles that takes it just a step to far, and literally turns Cyberpunk into a personal holy cruscade by demanding that others pay fielty to him, and trample on personal lifestyle choices, like whether or not to develop artificial intelligence.

And this excludes things like Radical Debranding, something I very highly doubt the author of Neuromancer intended as an instructions manual, and having people tell me I'm destroying the god damn planet by not de-birkenstocking my birkenstocks, and to still buy from name brands who have earned my trust as being quality products and services.

I'm just a reader of science fiction, this is not what I signed up for when I planned on getting into this genre. Japan has this thing where there are guys that will literally LARP military campaigns from World War II, so they can emulate Dear Leader. This is what Cyberpunk has kind of become, although granted at a much smaller scale.

But nobody should have to say that Cyberpunk novels are intended as fiction. I shouldn't have to say that my Alternate History graphic novel where Japan controls the East Coast, and French fascists control the west coast, is intended as a work of fiction. It is not an instruction manual for creating actual military campaigns on the god damn field.

I honestly can't even picture the US even being able to handle historical reinactors at this point, because for all I know somebody may actuall genuinely want to relive the fucking glory of the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany.
