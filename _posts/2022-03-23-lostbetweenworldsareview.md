Before we begin, I would like to introduce the reading Software Calibre: Calibre is a free and open source ebook software for those concerned about their digital rights management, and their ability to own whatever ebook they read. Calibre can take any number of electronic media files.

I'm currently reading the comic book Lost Between Worlds. It is about a young woman with deer-like horns who goes on assignments to to hunt for specific people, but for what purpose? In this installment, she begins by hunting for a specific band member.

## ART
WHen you open this book, you find a character design whose line thickness is a mixture of thick and thin, with special attention payed to the the design of the hair of the MCs. The art also excells is providing complementary colors between forest green and mid-range purple.

## LETTERING
The lettering is reminiscent of a lime, that hasn't yet been juiced. Some people like darker colors, and some people like brighter colors. My assumption is that the color of the caption is meant to indicate someone that has a slightly soured personality. One thing I'd note is that while the colors themselves are beautiful, the text ( or text box ) could be a little bit darker, and that might make it a little bit more legible.

## CHARACTER
The main character is something akin to a female grim repear, with her primary mission to transfer souls to the after life and await judgement. The others that die on their journey to the afterlife, have a healthy range of different personalities. One noteably seem unintimidating by Gwyn's dog. This sets the stage for other events to follow, involving a man who woke up seeing Gwyn. He tries to cheat the system, and convince Gwyn not to take transfer his soul to the afterlife. And eventually, hinting at a larger story involving the apocalypse, and how something from her world must be dealt with.

## OVERALL
If you'll looking for an oddly light hearted rendition about grim reapers, this is definitely a series to check out. In particularly I'm interested in finding out the story by the scyth.
